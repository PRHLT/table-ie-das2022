# Steps in order to use the GNN code:

## Prepare the environment

Create the environment

``conda env create --file environment/env.yml``

``conda activate tablas ``

## Data preparation:
- First, modify the script "data/launchers/launch_HisClima_Jeannette.sh" adding your data path (this should be the location of your pages)
- Then, execute data/launchers/launch_HisClima_Jeannette.sh

<> Note that the data/create_results.py is to slow. It should be recoded efficiently (as future works). 

## Train de system:
- Modify "launchers/launch_Hisclima_Jeanette_GT_NC.sh" with your paths.
- Execute.

## Evaluate:
- Modify information_extraction/launch_IE_JeanetteGT_DAS.sh with your paths
- Execute
